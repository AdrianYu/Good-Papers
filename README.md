- Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows: One of the best papers I read recently! A very good note can be found here
https://casmls.github.io/general/2016/09/25/normalizing-flows.html

An open question, as described in the reference note: ``whether the proposed normalizing flows is a universal approximator of all the distributions when the number of layers go to infinity."
Two technical questions: Do we still need to assume P(z_0) as a Gaussian distribution? Why is the model not scalable regarding to high-dimensional latent space?

- MADE: Masked Autoencoder for Distribution Estimation: An inspiring work! It shows how autoencoder can be used for density estimation. Of course doing that is non-trivial as a conventional autoencoder can simply memorize all the data given large enough units in hidden layers, implying it cannot be used for the task. The paper addresses this problem by structuring the network so that its output represents conditional probabilities of a dimension given the others. They proposed masked autoencoder to do so.

Question: This is a very nice framework, but how to make it work with real value?

- Improving Variational Inference with Inverse Autoregressive Flow: An interesting paper. It combines two successful approaches in deep generative models recently: normalizing flow and autoregressive models. While the idea of normalizing flow is powerful, the authors claimed they are not scalable (but why?). Their intuition is that Gaussian autoregressive functions can scale well to high-dimensional latent space. The idea of using autogressive models is seems a very good idea (e.g. see MADE, PixelCNN). The authors show that such functions can also turn into invertible non-linear transformations of the input. It therefore makes sense to use inverse Gaussian autoregressive functions as new flow. They show that their model achieve SOTA. A direct comparision between normalizing flow and inverse autoregressive flow is not performed, though!

It is quite surprising (at least to me) that applying many steps of conditional gaussian distributions can model arbitrary complex distribution. Why is that the case? I was wondering because in Normalizing Flows are designed to get rid of simple Gaussian distributions.

- Density estimation using Real NVP: A thought-provoking paper. Working with probabilistic generative models involve sampling (sample x given p(x)), inference (compute p(z|x) = p(z)p(x|z)/p(x) with latent (continuous) variables z) and exact likelihood computation (p(x) = int_{z}p(x|z)p(z)d(z). The paper proposes an interesting inversion models that address all the problems in a nice way. What I mean a nice way here is: exact sampling, easy to do inferenec and the likelihood can be computed easily. There seems no way of having such a model. But the author proves we can by exploiting bijective functions that map between each point of data (x) and a value of latent continous variable. The space of the variable must be easy to sample (e.g. a Gaussian: z ~ N(mean, variance)). Since we expoloiting bijective functions, it would be easy to find an inverse function of the bijective function so that given a point x, we can easily compute z (inference). Finally, the likelihood can be computed directly from the densitity function of z (it only involves additional computation regarding to the determinant of the Jocobian matrix with respect to the inverse function and x). Obviously, the bijective function must have a super rich representation to model arbitrary distribution, it must be easy and efficient to compute the Jacobian matrix (and the determinant of the matrix). The function they proposed relied on affine coupling layers. Relying on the idea everything can be done in a very neat way!

Question: how to train the model (maximize the likelhood of the data?) not sure I am missing something but they didn't describe that?
This is no doubt a very cool work, and I was wondering how to apply the model to NLP applications as well!
Finally, combining the model with VAE, GAN and autoagressive models could be a promising direction (see https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/courses/csc2541/slides/lec3-autoregressive.pdf)

- Wasserstein GAN: It is hard to write a short summary for such a great work! Some good references are here http://www.alexirpan.com/2017/02/22/wasserstein-gan.html and here https://vincentherrmann.github.io/blog/wasserstein/ It has won widespread praise for its novelties and beautiful results. For me there are 4 take-home messages from the paper:
1. It shows that encoding a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space is pretty much a task that traditional metrics such as KL-divergence and JS-divergence are not applicable (seeing the (abeit contrived) example to see why)). I am particularly interested in this, perhaps because I used to love KL-divergece very much (even after reading http://www.inference.vc/how-to-train-your-generative-models-why-generative-adversarial-networks-work-so-well-2/). Now we know for sure these divergences are not fitting to the problem, at least from the perspective of optimization.
2. They show that Earth-Mover distance (a.k.a Wasserstein distance) should be a better match. Let us recall that probability distributions are defined by how much mass they put on each point. The distance between two distances P_original and P_new is the minimal effort we need to move the mass (according to P_original) for all points in the space to a new space with the new mass (according to P_new). I have a bit difficulty of understanding the distance in the beginning, but I was (as everybody) indeed very pleased with its the intuition. I don't re-explain it again, and a good explanation of the distance can be found here https://www.cph-ai-lab.com/wasserstein-gan-wgan) 
3. The Earth-Mover distance is very nice, but intractable to compute. Their ingenious approach is to rely on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein dualty to reformulate the computation of Earth-Mover distance. Instead of computing the metric over each ``point" in the space, we can compute the metric based on the transformation of that point to another point in the same space. There is some constraint about the transformation, implying that the transformation function must be satisfied something. More particularly, they are 1-Lipschitz, i.e., functions where maximum value of slope is 1. In this way, computing the distance amounts to finding a transformation function f that maximizes a new and different objective. They dualty doesn't change the difficulty of the problem, of course, but it makes our life easier to perform an approximation. Let us assume a parametrized function family f_w where w are the weights. A lower bound objective that can be close to the true distance is about finding the weights to maximize our new objective - a pretty much trivial thing to do with neural networks (i.e. backpropagation). Interestingly, the functions do not have to be 1-Lipschitz, as they could be K-Lipschitz (the paper explains very well why it is the case). But in principle, K should not be too large and too small. They clip weights w, constraining them to lie with a small range [-0.1, 0.1] to make it work (an adhoc solution, however).
4. The training algorithm does not change much from the original GAN's training algorithm (it basically gets rid of ``unnecessary" logarithms). But we could gain pretty much from that (stable training). The new loss quite corresponds with image quality, which is pretty amazing. Too good to be true, right? Ala, that is not all their contributions. They even prove (Theorem 1 and 2) that everything comes for a reason!!!

What a good paper! There is no doubt that this is one of the best papers I read recently!
