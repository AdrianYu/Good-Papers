# Good-Papers

- Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows: One of the best papers I read recently! A very good note can be found here
https://casmls.github.io/general/2016/09/25/normalizing-flows.html

An open question, as described in the reference note: ``whether the proposed normalizing flows is a universal approximator of all the distributions when the number of layers go to infinity."
