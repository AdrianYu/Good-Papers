- *Gaussian Process Kernels for Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation* - https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4245

A very beautiful, yet very challenging paper to read! The thing GPs are really excellent at is regression. Yet it is still difficult
to discover patterns and enable extrapolation with standard kernels such as RBF.

The paper proposes a new one that kernel type that helps do so, while inference remains simple and analytic. (Experiments described in
section 4.4 say everything: the new one can learn very complex oscillatory pattern while others cannot.
