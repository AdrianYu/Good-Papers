WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio - https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499:
This is a very very very interesting paper. Like AlphaGo, I was very pleased to read the paper. The techniques themselves are
not new. Yet to make all things work, it would require significant experitse that Deep Mind researchers are second to none. 
Deep Learning is changing lots of things, turning impossible to possible. What a time to be alive!
Ps: The experiment about speech generation is very cool. It reminds me of this karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
