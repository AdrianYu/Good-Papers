- Sparse Gaussian Processes using Pseudo-inputs - https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2857-sparse-gaussian-processes-using-pseudo-inputs

Gaussian Processes is a very interesting/beautiful model (see this https://github.com/hoangcuong2011/Good-Papers/blob/master/Gaussian%20Process.md).
A problem with GPs is that it requires a complexity of O(N^3) to train. This paper proposes a new solution that has only O(M^2N) training cost. How?
